## Create Arrow files for BM uni-occupancy coCnT data, batches 1 and 2
## This script will create Arrow files for each sample, which will be used for downstream ArchR analysis.
## Parameters:
##   - Cells with < 100 fragments are filtered out
##   - TSS enrichment is not calculated at this step, as it is not used for filtering cells in this dataset. It can be calculated later if needed.
##   - The Arrow files will be created in the current working directory, with the same name as the sample name (e.g., "sample_name.arrow").
##   - maxFrags is set to Inf to include all fragments, as there is no upper limit on the number of fragments per cell in this dataset.
##   - excludeChr is set to "chrM" to exclude mitochondrial reads, as they are not informative for chromatin accessibility analysis and can introduce noise.
##   - does not add tile matrix and gene score matrix at this step to save time and disk space.
